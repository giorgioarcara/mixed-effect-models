## The second exercise is again on a hypothetical experiment
# Let's give some context:
# It is an experiment that record Accuracty  in a task with two main variables.
# 
# - StimType: 2 levels (Implicatures, Explicatures)
# - Group: 3 levels (Controls, Schizophrenics, Alzheimer)
#
# and three covariates
#
# - Interpretability (Item level)
# - Age (Subj level)
# - TOM (Subj level)


# you have 5 items per each StimType
# and 10 Subjects per group

#
# 
#
# In the past there have been some concerns that results are related to unbalanced Age across groups.
# Additionally some people claim that there could be effect of TOM (possibly different across StimType), but be careful
# performance in TOM task may be highly collinear with age.
# 
# There are recent results on this interpretability variable that may play a role not clear.
