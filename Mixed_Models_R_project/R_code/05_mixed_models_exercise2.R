## The second exercise is again on a hypothetical experiment
# Let's give some context:
# It is an experiment that record Reaction Times in a task with two main variables.
# 
# - StimType: 3 levels (Idiom, Metaphor, Proverb)
# - Difficulty: 2 levels (Easy vs Hard)
#
# and three covariates
#
# - Interpretability
# - Concreteness
# - NumberOfLetters
#
# 
# There is some concern that Interpretability and Concreteness may be highly correlated (issues of collinearity?)
# Moroever according to some recent papers effect of Interpretability may vary across the different stimulus type.
# There could also be some effect of fatigue during the experiment, that could be taken into account using Ntrial as a covraiate.
